# :wave: Hey there! I'm @JohnHenry-Ward
I am a Software Engineer with about 2 years of industry expereince. I graduated from Western Washington University in December 2021 with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Math. I am most interested in Full Stack Development, as I enjoy the design of the front end and
the technicality of the back end, but am open to any and all Software Engineer/Developer positions.

## ðŸŒ± What I'm currently working on
I'm currently looking for my next career opprotunity in the Software Engineering industry. My profressional expereience is more focused on backend work, but I enjoy working with the full stack. I'm currently working on my next personal project...stay tuned.

I am also practicing my Computer Science fundamentals and keeping my algorithm and data structure skills sharp by doing coding practice on whiteboards and online.
