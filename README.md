# :wave: Hey there! I'm @JohnHenry-Ward
I am a recent Computer Science grad looking for my first opprotunity in the software industry. 
I am most interested in Full Stack Web Development, as I enjoy the design of the front end and
the technicality of the back end. You can learn more about me, my skills, and some projects I've
worked on by checking out my portfolio website [here](http://johnhenryward.me).

## ðŸŒ± What I'm currently working on
In preperation for the 2022 Fifa World Cup, I am builing a Full Stack Website where a user can create groups, 
invite others, and then draft teams to root for once the games begin. Players get points for their teams winning (or tieing), 
and the farther one of their teams go, the more points they get (similar to March Madness). As my current interested align with Full Stack Web Development, 
I am building this website on the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack, using third-party API's, using Google Sign in with OAuth, and also practicing my 
client side and server side JavaScript skills. I am also considering learning another web development for this project tool like Next.js or SaSS.

I am also practicing my Computer Science fundamentals and keeping my algorithm and data structure skills sharp by doing coding practice problems daily on leetcode.
